	<description>Adds a new larger lategame (for big endgame bases) camera + research, and displays the camera radius when placing them and entities no longer receive cover from standing behind a camera.

- Performance impact: Unknown. However using fewer larger cameras instead of many smaller ones probably reduces performance drain.
- Mod is XML and XPath only but uses code from the original author's assembly.
- Can safely be added to an existing game.
- Can safely be removed from an existing game providing you destroy any structures from this mod and stop any research in progress related to this mod.
- Requires the Real Fog of War mod loaded BEFORE this mod.

Important note: Real Fog of War mod was not created by me. I only created these modifications for quality of life and to prevent big endgame bases to spam tons and tons of cameras everywhere.
Dev note: I created a base-class so that adding more camera-types in the future will be cleaner and faster.</description>
